t.sh — the local test harness: one subcommand per question a test run raises

  t.sh run [FLAGS] -- CMD...           did it pass: CMD's own status, the whole log kept and read even at 0
  t.sh flaky N [FLAGS] -- CMD...       do N runs of the same code disagree
  t.sh bisect GOOD [FLAGS] -- CMD...   which commit between GOOD and HEAD broke it
  t.sh falsify [FLAGS] [FILTER] -- CMD...
                                       which guards the suite would not notice being broken
  t.sh prove [FLAGS] [REF] -- CMD...   does the commit's own test go red when its fix is taken away
  t.sh help [SUBCOMMAND | codes]       this, or one subcommand's flags, or the exit codes
  t.sh bisect-probe [FLAGS] -- CMD...  internal: the single-commit verdict git bisect run calls

The command is always explicit, after `--`: a harness that guesses what your suite is
runs the wrong thing on the day it matters. The flags every subcommand forwards to run:

  -l DIR       where the logs go (default .test-logs, or `logdir` in the policy)
  -m SET       add a marker set: a name from markers/ beside this script, or a file path;
               markers/default.txt always applies, and a set that resolves to nothing refuses
  -p PATTERN   add one marker for this run, matched case-insensitively as a fixed string
  -t N         how many lines of the log to show after a verdict that is not a pass (run: 40)

A repository keeps its policy in ./tests/t.conf, read from the current directory only and
never the command: `markers NAME`, `pattern TEXT`, `allow REGEX`, `logdir PATH`. An unknown
key, a key with no value or a set that does not exist stops the run and names the line.

The environment:

  T_ALLOW      an extended regex; matching log lines are excused before the scan. Overrides
               the policy's `allow`. A regex grep cannot compile is refused, never ignored
  T_LOGDIR     where the logs go; -l overrides it, the policy's `logdir` is under it
  T_LOGFILE    one log file for one run, instead of a name chosen under the log directory
  T_CONFIG     another policy file; T_CONFIG= (empty) reads none

Exit status: CMD's own, passed through unchanged, and the harness's own verdicts in a band
no test runner uses — `t.sh help codes`.
EOF

help_run() {

t.sh run [-l DIR] [-m SET] [-p PATTERN] [-t N] -- CMD...

Runs CMD once. The status reported is CMD's own — read from PIPESTATUS, never from the
tee that keeps the log — and the log is read even when CMD exited 0, because that is not
always a success: `collected 0 items`, `no tests ran`, a traceback in a passing run. The
markers of such a run live in markers/*.txt as data; markers/default.txt always applies,
-m adds a set, -p adds one line.

The kind of verdict — pass, fail or lied — is written beside the log as LOG.verdict, one
word, so a wrapper can read it without guessing from the number.

one: nothing here retries, and the logs of every run are kept under one directory.

git bisect run between GOOD and HEAD, judging each commit with run. -b BUILD runs first
at every commit, and a commit that does not build is skipped rather than blamed; so is one
whose run exited 0 while its log says nothing ran, and one where the runner is not there.
A crash of the suite is bad; a Ctrl-C is passed through so git aborts. --first-parent and
--no-checkout are git's own. The working tree must be clean and no bisect may already be
in progress; the tree is put back afterwards, interrupt included, and git's session log
is kept beside the run's logs as bisect.log for `git bisect replay`.

Exit: 0 with the first bad commit named on its own line; 89 when only commits that could
not answer are left between good and bad; 64 for a usage error; 70 when git failed.

Breaks one guard at a time, as written by hand in FILE (default tests/defects.sh, see
templates/defects.sh), and requires the suite to notice. FILTER runs only the defects
whose name contains it. Nothing is generated, and the defect list is sourced: it is code.

  -d FILE             the defect list
  -b BUILD            a command that must succeed before the suite is asked; an edit that
                      stops it is `unusable`, never credited to the suite
  --timeout SECONDS   the deadline for one run; default five times the unbroken suite's own
                      time or twenty seconds, whichever is more
  --out DIR           where the findings go (default falsify.out): one file of names per
                      verdict, a log per defect, results.json, written as the run goes
  --since REF         only the defects in files changed since REF — a filter for a pull
                      request, not a proof; an empty selection is said out loud, exit 0
  --shard I/N         run every Nth defect, starting at the Ith: N checkouts cover the list
                      between them, each with its own summary and exit code, and the run is
                      parallel without anything here being concurrent. One checkout per
                      shard — two shards sharing a tree would meet each other's mutants
  --worktree          edit a checkout of HEAD in a git worktree instead of the files in
                      front of you, so an editor, a watcher or a commit cannot meet a mutant
  --any-file          allow a defect in a test, vendored or generated file, which is
                      otherwise refused because it proves nothing about the suite

Verdicts: caught, SURVIVED with the file, the line and the edit, expected (declared with
`expect survived REASON`), stale, unusable, TIMEDOUT. On a GitHub runner each finding is
also an annotation on its file and line.

Exit: 0 all caught; 83 a survivor; 84 a timeout; 85 the suite red or never really run
before any edit; 87 the list drifted, or a declared exception was disproved; 88 an edit
only stopped the build; 64 for a usage error; 70 when a file could not be written back.

rest is the fix, --any-file counts everything as the fix. The suite must be green with
the fix in first. A commit other than HEAD is proven in a worktree at that commit;
--worktree does the same for HEAD. -b and --timeout as in falsify.

Exit: 0 proven; 83 VACUOUS, the tests pass without the fix; 84 the suite did not finish;

error, pytest uses 2 to 5, cargo-nextest exits 4 for "no tests ran".

  64  a usage error — a flag, the config, a missing --, an allow regex grep rejects
  70  the harness itself failed — a log it cannot write, a file it cannot put back
  79  CMD exited 0 but its log says it did not do what a pass claims (run)
  83  a defect SURVIVED (falsify); the tests pass without the fix, VACUOUS (prove)
  84  a defect, or the fix taken away, never let the suite finish (falsify, prove)
  85  the suite was red, or never really ran, before any edit was made (falsify, prove)
  86  the runs disagreed with each other (flaky)
  87  the defect list has drifted, or a declared exception was disproved (falsify)
  88  a defect, or the fix taken away, only stopped the build (falsify, prove)
  89  only commits that could not answer are left between good and bad (bisect)
